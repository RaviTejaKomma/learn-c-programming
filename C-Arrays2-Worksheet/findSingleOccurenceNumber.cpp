/*
OVERVIEW: Given an array where every element occurs three times, except one element which occurs only
once. Find the element that occurs once.
E.g.: Input: arr = 12, 1, 12, 3, 12, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3
ouput: 2

INPUTS: Integer array and length of the array.

OUTPUT: Element that occurs only once.

ERROR CASES: Return -1 for invalid inputs.

NOTES:
There are better ways of solving the problem than a brute-force solution which is of O(n^2)
complexity .
